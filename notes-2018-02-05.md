
The new homework is up. The task is to update the memory game to evaluate the rules of the game in the server. This makes it harder to cheat. Ad blockers work this way. This concept is important for multiplayer games, like our first project.

How will I copy the project and config files from the other repo to the *cs5610hw05* repo?

The plan right now is to get the examples working, read through the docs to understand what is going on, then get to work on Homework 5.

* We want the server to have persistent state for the game
    * Allow the player to pause a game and come back later
* Successfully deploying a *web socket* app is part of the assignment grade

## Data Flow
* User input -> Update state - Re-render

## New Data Flow
* User input -> Send to server -> Update state -> Send to client -> Re-render
* Only show the client what they need to know (send the view)

## Today's Lecture
### What Is a Web Socket?
* Two core HTTP methods
    * GET - Download something
    * POST - Upload something
* Problem
    * All basic HTTP requests must be initiated by the client
    * Polling isn't the best solution
    * *Web sockets* are better
* Web Sockets
    * Most firewalls close all but the HTTP ports
    * Translates TCP to HTTP and vice versa
* Protocol Stack
    * IP - unreliable, packets
    * TCP - reliable, streams
    * HTTP - request / response built on top of TCP
    * Web Sockets    
    * Phoenix - what we will use with *channels*
* Double to Number Form Websocket Example
    * Add Elixir functionality
    * `mix phx.gen.channel games`
        * Creats files in the _channels_ directory
        * `channel "games:"*, HangmanWeb.GamesChannel`
    * _assets/js/socket.js_
    * _lib/hangman_web/app.html.eex_
    * Read through the instructions in the _socket.js_ file
    * Pull some socket logic from _socket.js_ to _app.js_
    * (Put the script for the user token in the application layout)
    * `def join("games:" <> name, ...)`
    * create a game page _game.html.eex_ under the _templates_ dir somewhere
    * `$('#game-button').click(() => {})`
    * `channel.push()`
    * Check the docs: https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/channels.html
    * "The channel is a process that is maintaining state using recursion"
* Hangman Server-Side Example
    * Open _router.ex_
    * Use the `PageController`
    * "If it's coming in from a web browser, it's gonna be a String."
    * _templates/page/game..._
    * h1 heading that reads "Hangman Game: demo"
    * Pass the channel as a property
    * Join the channel in the class constructor
    * `gotView(msg) { this.setState(msg.view); }`
    * *Delete all the game logic from the JavaScript file*
    * *Make sure to pass the channel through in the appropriate JS file*
    * `%{ games | guesses: [guesses0 | guessses]}`

```
    <!-- make a global??? -->
    <script>
        window.gameName = ""
    </script>
```

```
    this.state = { skel: "", goods: [], bads: [], max: 10}
```
